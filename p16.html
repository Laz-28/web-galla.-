    <p>The German Shepherd is a breed of working dog that originated in Germany.</p>
    <p>The breed is known for its courage, loyalty, and ability to excel at almost anything it is trained to do.</p>
    <p>German Shepherds are large, strong, and intelligent dogs that make great companions and protectors.</p>
    <p>They are often used as police dogs, search and rescue dogs, and service dogs.</p>
    <p>I'd like to have one in the future</p>
